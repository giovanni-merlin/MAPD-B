    "Distributed computing over a cluster is a widely adopted strategy in the case of many applications both in- and out-side academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immagine you are interested in working on a very large dataset, at the scale of hundreds of Terabytes or even Petabytes.\n",
    "As discussed in the Data Management part of the course, a large horizontally scalable storage solution is going to be necessary to host the entire dataset.\n",
    "Even if we assume the storage solution is sorted out, we are left with the issue... how can we deal with all these data in order to produce the \"final result\" we aim at?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data are distributed over many nodes, and collecting all data in one node (e.g. loading the entire dataset in a single computer memory) would be impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not all data in the entire dataset is necessarily going to be relevant to solve your problem. You may want to first load all data, explore it, filter it and pre-process it\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, you may want to move to the actual data analysis phase, and possibly to the application machine learning models on the preprocess data. However, even the preprocessed data may not be enough to fit your local machine memory, and once again a distributed system is going to be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you would like to do is to run the pre-processing on the nodes of the cluster where the data is distributed, and return only the high level quantities that will be used in the analysis, or even the end-result of the entire analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core concept of distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark: the code/execution goes to the data, rather than the data coming to the machine where the code resides (data locality). "
